toIntransit requires: config.php, dismatrix.php, randomManufacturer.php, and randomWarehouse.php

May eventually be removed from functionality: distance calculated by dismatrix.php is stored in the shipments table (field remaining_dist) for use by my original moveOrder.

moveOrder I have placed in blocked because it needs the shortest path data to move an order from warehouse to warehouse which additional database requirements.

randomManufacturer and randomWarehouse get passed the $db variable via toInTransit, as requiring once config.php in all files causes problems.

Change require paths to however it is on your computer, and add remaining_dist field or comment out the distance updating code in order to run.
